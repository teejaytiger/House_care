# Feeding The Animals
## Eska and the kitten
- Eska eats a heaping cup (as in a baking cup, not a whole tumbler) of kibble twice daily. She'll wait for you to tell her to "go ahead." Sweet baby macaroni gets wet food twice a day, instructions are on the whiteboard. 
## Thunderboom Lightningheart (the bunny)
- He has free range of the backyard and eats the grass. I'll supply him with treats and kibble and water before we leave, and that will last more than enough time. He and the dog have an understanding, they're totally fine unsupervised. You don't have to do anything in the backyard. 
## The Cats
- The cats have a gravity feeder, so you shouldn't need to do anything food related.
- Check their litter boxes. You can use grocery bags for the contents. 

## Water
- just make sure the communal water bowl is full. Cold tap is fine. 

# Going potty
Just open the back door, the orange cats might try to get out, so just be observant of them so they don't.

# Other Stuff
- The front door needs to be locked at all times, because it won't stay shut otherwise lol please close it. 

- Eska will typically hang out by the back door if she needs something. She will stare at you until you figure out which thing she needs lol

- Just leave the windows shut. A lot of them are broken...

# Tech
 I think you're already set up to cast in our house just by being on the WiFi and going to whatever app in your phone you're trying to watch something on and clicking the cast button, but you can text and ask if you have trouble figuring anything out.
